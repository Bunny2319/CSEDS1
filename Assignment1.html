    <h1><I><p style="text-align: center";>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</I></h1>
    <PRE><p style="text-align: center";>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;

    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there    
    Had worn them really about the same,

    <h1><I><p style="text-align: center";>STOPPING BY WOOD SNOWY EVENING</I></h1>
    <PRE><p style="text-align: center";>
    Whose woods these are I think I know.
    His house is in the village though;   
    He will not see me stopping here   
    To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

    My little horse must think it queer   
    To stop without a farmhouse near   
    Between the woods and frozen lake   
    The darkest evening of the year.

    <h1><I><p style="text-align: center";>AFTER APPLE PICKING</p></I></h1>
    <PRE><p style="text-align: center";>
    My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
    Toward heaven still,
    And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
    Beside it, and there may be two or three
    Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
    But I am done with apple-picking now.
    Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
    The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
    I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
    I got from looking through a pane of glass
    I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
    And held against the world of hoary grass.
    It melted, and I let it fall and break.
