    <PRE>
    Global warming is a phenomenon of climate change characterized by a general increase
    in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems
    for a long time. It is directly linked to the increase of greenhouse gases in our 
    atmosphere, worsening the greenhouse effect.

        In fact, the average temperature of the planet has increased by 0.8º Celsius
        (33.4° Fahrenheit) compared to the end of the 19th century. Each of the last 
        three decades has been warmer than all previous decades since the beginning of 
        the statistical surveys in 1850.

    At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between 
    1.5° and 5.3°C (34.7° to 41.5°F) in average temperature by 2100. If no action is
    taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the biosphere.</PRE>

        <h2><i>CAUSES</i></h2>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon. However, the increase in greenhouse 
        gases is linked to human activities. It is thus no surprise that the world's leading 
        climate scientists believe that human activities are very likely the main cause of 
        global warming since the mid-twentieth century, mostly because of:</p>
